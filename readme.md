Implementation of meet in the middle attack against double
applications of a symmetric cipher, showing why multiple encryption is not a good appraoch, when encryption and decryption key becomes same.
Performs exhaustive key search for known plaintext and ciphertext.

Pydes twhiteman.netfirms.com/pyDES/pyDes-2.0.1.zip for DES encryption/decryption.

Usage:
python meetinthemiddle.py plaintext ciphertext keylength

eg:
plaintext: W3110D0N30GUY500
ciphertext: 3d629cc4cf87f1886b6c8daf750c114e
